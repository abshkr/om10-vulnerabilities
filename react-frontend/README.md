## Tech Stack:

**React v16**: React is the main driver for the Front end. It was the best choice simply due to the large amount of community driven and high available libraries.

**Charts.js**: Charts.JS was chosen simply due to its flexibility. It sadly does not offer the same level of functionality as D3 but It's well maintained and performs to our standards.

**Express**: The Speed of prototyping and development provided via Express is unparalleled. It has helped TIDE go through many iterations with ease and speed.

**Redux**: Global State Management with a focus on security..

**Lodash**: Provides Functional Utility for JavaScript making the development process quick.

**Jest & Enzyme**:  Jest and Enzyme is a deadly combo for Front end testing. They work wonderfully with React and with the help of Travis-CI.

## UI/UX Components:

**Smooth**: At the moment, Smooth takes care of all the component Animations, Mainly while transitioning into other pages or components.

**Responsive**: React Responsive is a library that allows us to easily port our CSS into different types of displays. This makes the process of providing a UI thats both compatible with Desktops, Tables and Mobile Phones.

**Ant Design**: This library was only recently adopted into our library set. It has proven to be extremely useful in creating beautiful UI Components that are multi lingual.
