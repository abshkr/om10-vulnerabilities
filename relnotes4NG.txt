BZ: [OM5K-4000] The field should not show the warning message
Solution: In screen 'Delivery Location', replace the validation type of field 'Delv Loc Code' with 'alphanumericspecial' which will allow DOT in the text. In popup 'Customers linked to Delivery Location', set the validation type as 'document'.


BZ: [OM5K-2752] Updated base product, Journal said change [0] to [2] which is not make sense to customers
Solution: 
1. Create a JSON file 'langEnums.json' to save enum messages.
2. Create a JSON file 'langColumnEnums.json' to save the relations of columns and enums.
3. When system records the journal of an UPDATE action, checks the JSON files to see if the changed field has the relation to enums, if found, record the enum texts of old/new values; otherwise, just records the old/new values.
4. Examples:
Person [DKI_SUPER_USER(9999)], Action [Update], Field [Base Ref Temp Spec], Old Value [3::60F], New Value [1::COMPENSTN_PT], Screen [Base Products]. Record key: [Base Code=TSTJNL1].
Person [DKI_SUPER_USER(9999)], Action [Update], Field [Base Cat], Old Value [2::Gasolines], New Value [4::Diesel oils/Fuel oils/Heating oils], Screen [Base Products]. Record key: [Base Code=TSTJNL1].


BZ: [OM5K-3806] Journalling need to support multilingual
Solution:
1. Create a JSON file 'langColumns.json' to save multilingual labels for table columns.
2. Create a JSON file 'langMessages.json' to save multilingual labels for fields, actions, results and screens.
3. When system records the journal, get the labels from these two JSON files, construct the messages in  multiple languages and then record them.
4. Create a JSON file 'langEnums.json' to save multilingual labels for enums.
5. Create a JSON file 'langColumnEnums.json' to save the relationship between columns and enums/tables, which may have the following values for a column:
	a. 'NA'
	b. 'ENUM_TYPE_NAME'
	c. 'ENUM|ENUM_TYPE_NAME|LANG_OPTION|INP_CLN|OUT_CLN'
	d. 'TABLE|TABLE_NAME|LANG_OPTION|INP_CLN|OUT_CLN'
	e. 'ENUMBIT|ENUM_TYPE_NAME|LANG_OPTION|INP_CLN|OUT_CLN'
6. When system prepare the old/new values for the journal, get the column setting from 'langColumnEnums.json', and do the following actions:
	a. 'NA' 
		- use the original value
	b. 'ENUM_TYPE_NAME' 
		- get the label from 'langEnums.json' according to language code, enum type name, and value. The label would look like: '1::Gasoline'.
	c. 'ENUM|ENUM_TYPE_NAME|LANG_OPTION|INP_CLN|OUT_CLN'
		- get the label from ENUM SQL scripts according to language code, enum type name, input field, output field and value. The label would look like: '1::Gasoline'.
	d. 'TABLE|TABLE_NAME|LANG_OPTION|INP_CLN|OUT_CLN'
		- get the label from TABLE SQL scripts according to language code, table name, input field, output field and value. The label would look like: '1000099::Diesel 10'.
	e. 'ENUMBIT|ENUM_TYPE_NAME|LANG_OPTION|INP_CLN|OUT_CLN'
		- get the label list from ENUM SQL scripts according to language code, enum type name, input field, output field and value. Binary functions are performed and the label would look like: '122::SUPPLIER,CUSTOMER,DRAWER,ISSUER,EMPLOYER'.
7. After the enhancement, the journal message written by PHP would look like the following
	a. action: CREATE 
	   format: Person [user name(user code)], Action [Create], Value [main values of new record], Screen [screen/table name]. Record key: [KEY column=KEY value].
	   example: Person [DKI_SUPER_USER(9999)], Action [Create], Value [[TSTJNL1 - tstjnl1]], Screen [Base Products]. Record key: [Base Code=TSTJNL1].
	b. action: DELETE 
	   format: Person [user name(user code)], Action [Delete], Value [main values of new record], Screen [screen/table name]. Record key: [KEY column=KEY value].
	   example: Person [DKI_SUPER_USER(9999)], Action [Delete], Value [[TSTJNL1 - tstjnl1]], Screen [Base Products]. Record key: [Base Code=TSTJNL1].
	c. action: UPDATE 
	   format: Person [user name(user code)], Action [Update], Field [table column name], Old Value [old value ID/code::old value label], New Value [new value ID/code::new value label], Screen [screen/table name]. Record key: [KEY column=KEY value].
	   example: Person [DKI_SUPER_USER(9999)], Action [Update], Field [Cmpy Type], Old Value [172::CARRIER,CUSTOMER,ISSUER,HOST], New Value [122::SUPPLIER,CUSTOMER,DRAWER,ISSUER,EMPLOYER], Screen [Companys]. Record key: [Cmpy Code=TSTJNL].
