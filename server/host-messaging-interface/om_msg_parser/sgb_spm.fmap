# Field mapping
# - Lines beginning with hash will be treated as comments and will be ignored
# - One mapping per line, of the format: source_field,target_field.
# - The value of the target field will be the value of the source field. If the source field is not specified or has no value,
#   the target field will be created and filled with blank.
# - Lines that do not conform to this format will be ignored
#
# - Leave this file blank and do the customisation in the custom script. This simplifies the process and reduce the mental load.
