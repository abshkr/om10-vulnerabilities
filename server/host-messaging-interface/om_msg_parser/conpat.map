# The format of each entry in this file is as follows:
# Contact partner code, mapped-to company name, mapped-to company code, mapped-to plant code, mapped-to storage location code
#
# The first field forms the key of one entry in the mapping table. The remainder fields become the value list.
# This mapping table is used to translate the specified contact partner code (1st field) to
# 1. an Omega company code (3rd field, which is used as the product company), and
# 2. a plant code (4th field).
# 3. an alternate storage location (5th field, which is actually a company).
