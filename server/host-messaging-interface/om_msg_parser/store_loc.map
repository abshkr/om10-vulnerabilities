# The format of each entry in this file is as follows:
# Partner storage location code, mapped-to Company name, mapped-to Company code, mapped-to Storage location code
#
# The first field forms the key of one entry in the mapping table. The remainder fields become the value list.
# This mapping table is used to translate the specified partner storage location code (1st field) to
# 1. an Omega company code (3rd field, which is used as the product company), and
# 2. an alternate storage location (4th field, which is actually a company).
