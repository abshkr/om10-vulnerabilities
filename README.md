  OMEGA 5000 - Master Repository for the Client & Server
</h3>
<p align="center">
  The Omega 5000 Terminal Automation System has been designed with distributed processing in mind to allow for multiple levels of fallback operation. For example, if communications to a Host Mainframe is interrupted then the system can be operated without the host. Similarly the Truck loading controllers can operate in a standalone mode when required.
